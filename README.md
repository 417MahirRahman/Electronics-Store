# TechNest — Mini Electronics E-Commerce Application

# 📖 About

TechNest is a beginner-friendly mini e-commerce web application built using Next.js (App Router). The project focuses on building a clean and responsive product browsing experience while learning modern frontend concepts such as routing, component structure, and data handling.

The application displays a list of electronic products sourced from a local JSON data file, allowing users to browse items and view detailed product information without relying on a backend API. This approach keeps the project simple while still reflecting real-world data-driven UI patterns.

A basic mock authentication system is implemented using hardcoded credentials and cookies to simulate login behavior and protect specific routes, such as the product creation page. Public pages remain accessible to all users, while protected pages demonstrate basic access control logic.

The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, enabling rapid UI development with consistent and reusable components. TechNest is designed as a learning-focused project that helps strengthen understanding of Next.js App Router, route protection, and structured frontend development.
